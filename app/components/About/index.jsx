              At Sarva, our journey began with a simple idea: to create fashion that celebrates individuality and authenticity. Founded by Saloni Gavde, Sarva was born from a passion for creativity and a desire to redefine comfort and style. Inspired by India's rich, diverse culture and bustling textile markets, Saloni envisioned a brand that blends contemporary design with timeless elegance.

              The story started during my college years, where I was influenced by global fashion trends and the narratives behind handcrafted pieces. Determined to build a clothing line that champions sustainability and quality, I committed to sourcing fine fabrics and collaborating with skilled artisans who share this vision.

              Every Sarva collection is thoughtfully curated to embody our philosophy: clothing should be more than just what you wearâ€”it should be a statement of who you are. Our goal is to provide a wardrobe that empowers and inspires, giving customers confidence and a sense of value.
